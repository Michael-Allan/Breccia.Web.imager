<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        This project enables Breccian markup to be clearly shown on the Web.  It maintains tools
        and resources for this purpose, the principal tool being an image compiler that transforms
        Breccian source code to HTML and assembles it for Web publication.
