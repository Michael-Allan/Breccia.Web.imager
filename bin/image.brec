`image` - Make a Web image

        image <path>…

    - The `image` command makes a Web image.
        - It ensures that each Breccian source file stored at or under the given paths
          is accompanied by its image, a sibling namesake with a `.xht` extension.
        - It reforms any image file that does not postdate both its source
          and all Breccian referents of its source.
    - The working directory must be the command directory.
